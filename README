You have a simple text file with IPv4 addresses. One line is one address, line by line:

```
145.67.23.4
8.34.5.23
89.54.3.124
89.54.3.124
3.45.71.5
...
```

The file is unlimited in size and can occupy tens and hundreds of gigabytes.

You should calculate the number of __unique addresses__ in this file using as little memory and time as possible.
